# Youtube-Clone
HTML and CSS Youtube Clone
Welcome to my YouTube Home Page Clone! In this project, I recreated the layout of YouTube home page using only HTML and CSS. As a passionate full-stack developer, I wanted to demonstrate my proficiency in crafting intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Throughout this project, I honed my CSS skills, employing advanced techniques to achieve responsive design, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. 

My goal in building this clone was not only to demonstrate my technical prowess but also to showcase my passion for creating user-centric and visually appealing websites.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this demonstration of my front-end skills!
